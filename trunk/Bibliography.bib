	abstract = {An ontology is a computer-processable collection of knowledge about the world. This PhD thesis explains how an ontology can be constructed and expanded auto-matically. The proposed approach consists of three contributions: 1. A core ontology, YAGO. YAGO is an ontology that has been constructed automatically. It combines high accuracy with large coverage and serves as a core that can be expanded. 2. A tool for information extraction, LEILA. LEILA is a system that can extract knowledge from natural language texts. LEILA will be used to 2nd new facts for YAGO. 3. An integration mechanism, SOFIE. SOFIE is a system that can reason on the plausibility of new knowledge. SOFIE will assess the facts found by LEILA and integrate theminto YAGO. Each of these components comes with a fully implemented system. Together,they form an integrative architecture, which does not only gather new facts,but also reconcile them with the existing facts. The result is an ever-growing,yet highly accurate ontological knowledge base. A survey of applications of theontology completes the thesis.},

OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals, and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents. The OWL 2 Document Overview describes the overall state of OWL 2, and should be read before other OWL 2 documents.

This primer provides an approachable introduction to OWL 2, including orientation for those coming from other disciplines, a running example showing how OWL 2 can be used to represent first simple information and then more complex information, how OWL 2 manages ontologies, and finally the distinctions between the various sublanguages of OWL 2.

  ABSTRACT = {One of the challenging tasks in the context of the Semantic Web is to
automatically extract instances of binary relations from Web documents
-- for example all pairs of a person and the corresponding birthdate. In this paper, we present LEILA, a
system that can extract instances of arbitrary given binary relations
from natural language Web documents -- without human interaction.
Different from previous approaches, LEILA uses a deep syntactic
analysis. This results in consistent improvements over comparable
systems (such as e.g. Snowball or TextToOnto).

  abstract = {RDF is a directed, labeled graph data format for representing information in the Web. This specification defines the syntax and semantics of the SPARQL query language for RDF. SPARQL can be used to express queries across diverse data sources, whether the data is stored natively as RDF or viewed as RDF via middleware. SPARQL contains capabilities for querying required and optional graph patterns along with their conjunctions and disjunctions. SPARQL also supports extensible value testing and constraining queries by source RDF graph. The results of SPARQL queries can be results sets or RDF graphs.}
