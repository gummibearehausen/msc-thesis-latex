  Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a consolidated technique fo.
Nevertheless, it's inherently expensive and the hypothesis search space combinatorially with the knowledge base size.
This problem is even more dramatic when hypothesis with constants are considerated, often making it an unfeasible task.
In this thesis, we propose a preprocessing step and an extension to ILP, that suggests the most interesting categorical
constants to be added to the hypothesis. It consists of building a Lattice that expresses the correlations between one
and multiple other categorical relations and their constants. With that, in the top-down ILP refinement step, one can
query this Correlation Lattice and find out the categories that will most likely produce subpopulations with different
characteristics
