  Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a consolidated technique for mining first-order rules in knowledge bases.
Nevertheless, it's inherently expensive and the hypothesis search space grows combinatorially with the knowledge base size.
This problem is even more dramatic when literals with constants are considered. Therefore, it usually requires very
aggressive pruning for making it feasible. In the preprocessing step, we build a lattice that expresses the
correlations between a root numerical attribute and multiple categorical relations and their constants. This lattice
is then queried by the core ILP algorithm in the refinement step in order to obtain the interestingness of searching
for interesting intervals of a given numerical attribute variable, as well as a list of refinement suggestions ordered
by a defined interestingness measure. This thesis discusses how to efficiently build the lattice, how it's
incorporated in the core learning algorithm and evaluates different iterestingness measures.
