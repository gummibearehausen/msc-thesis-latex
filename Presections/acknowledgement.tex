Firstly, I would like to thank my parents, for their unconditional support.

Also, I would like to thank my advisor \supname, for his invaluable guidance. I feel deeply grateful for his technical
assistance and motivational encouragement. 

A special note of thanks to Prof. Dr. Gerhard Weikum, for reviewing this thesis and giving me the opportunity to work at
the Database and Information Systems department. It was a very enriching and pleasant experience to do my Master Thesis
there.
