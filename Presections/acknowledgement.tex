Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor \supname, for his invaluable guidance. I feel deeply grateful for his technical assistance and motivational encouragement. 

A special note of thanks to Prof. Gerhard Weikum for giving me the opportunity to pursue this thesis at Infomation and Database Systems department under his supervision. It was a very enriching and pleasant experience to write my Master Thesis here.
