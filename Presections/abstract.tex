  Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a consolidated technique for mining Datalog rules in knowledge bases.
Nevertheless, it's inherently expensive and the hypothesis search space grows combinatorially with the knowledge base size.
This problem is even more dramatic when literals with constants are considerated, therefore, a it usually requires very aggressive pruning for making it feasible.
With the objective of efficiently learning rules with interesting ranges for numerical attributes, we propose a preprocessing step and an extension to ILP top-down algorithm, that suggests the most interesting categorical constants to be added in the refinement step. It consists of building a Lattice that expresses the correlations between a root numerical attribute and multiple categorical relations and their constants. This lattice is then queried by the core ILP algorithm in the refinement step and provides a list of refinement suggestions ordered by a defined interestingness measure. This thesis discusses how to efficiently build the lattice, how it's incorporated in the core learning algorithm and evaluates different iterestingness measures.
